### Introduction:

The study of religion in South Asia has been a field of scholarly inquiry sometimes driven by the categorization of discrete religions and other times by the concordance of salient or distinctive themes found within the geographical region of South Asia. A third orientation to the study of religion in South Asia has been to attend to frontier spaces, boundaries, and movement as zones of inquiry which reject the tidiness of the former two categorizations. Scholars have also paid attention to how memories, stories, and storytelling operate as key components of religion in South Asia and the study thereof. These “on-the-ground” elements often prioritize different facets of religious practice and community belonging from relatively “official” metrics such as censuses, histories, and (court/high) literature.

* Amin, Shahid. *Conquest and Community: The Afterlife of Warrior Saint Ghazi Miyan*. New Delhi: Orient BlackSwan, 2015.

> This book focuses on the cult of Ghazi Miyan, a Muslim warrior who likely never historically lived, but whose legend has inspired a devotional following that challenges the distinctions between “Hindu” and “Muslim.” Amin posits that the cult of Ghazi Miyan enables us, as scholars of religion in South Asia, to consider how the history of interactions between Hindus and Muslims is one that should neither be reduced to episodes of incalcitrant enmity nor sugar-coated as one without violence. The book is germane to discussions of pilgrimage, interreligious devotion, the politicization of memory/history, and the manner by which local memory may diverge from measurable history without losing its importance.

* Appadurai, Arjun. “The Production of Locality.” In *Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization*, 178–99. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996.

> The axiom that Appadurai takes for granted is that society strives to create and maintain locality. He posits that locality is relational rather than scalar and contextual rather than spatial; i.e. locality is a phenomenological quality. He asks: how does locality relate to the neighborhood? Has this relationship changed since the rise of the nation-state? He answers: locality is an inherently fragile social achievement. Rites of passage, for example, are concerned with locating bodies within spatially and socially defined communities. *Much of cosmology, naming, and material production is not for the sake of materials so much as the socialization of space and time, or of the spatiotemporal production of locality.*

* Bellamy, Carla. *The Powerful Ephemeral: Everyday Healing in an Ambiguously Islamic Place*. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2011.

> Bellamy writes about Husain Tekri, a *dargah* in the village of Jaora, just south of Rajasthan and East of Gujarat, in the state of Madhya Pradesh. She writes of the Sufi shrine as an “ambiguously Islamic place,” thereby offering a contribution to scholarly distinctions made between “Islamic,” “Islamicate,” and “South Asian.” Of note is the fact that the visitors to the *dargah* are from religiously plural backgrounds, but that many of the women who attend dress in ways that allow onlookers to assume that they are Muslim (which affords them anonymity). Bellamy attends to the solidarity of female visitors who collectively recognize the power of the sacred site through the recitation of miraculous narratives. These narratives foreground the common experiences of women who suffer and rise above hardship through the fulfilment of vows in relation to the temple. In other words, gender contributes to the cohesion of a religiously plural community at the space.
