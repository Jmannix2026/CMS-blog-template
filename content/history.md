The Temple of The Tooth in History



The Temple of the Tooth is a Buddhist temple situated in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and has been destroyed, rebuilt, and redefined over its long history. The temple is home to a tooth of Siddartha Gautama, which was preserved following his cremation after his death in 486 BCE. The Sacred tooth relic was brought to Sri Lanka by Princess Hemamala and Prince Dantha from the city of Kalinga in ancient India, during the reign of King Keerthi Sri Meghavarna (Kithsirimevan 301- 328 CE). The relic became a symbol of Sri Lankan kings and was fiercely guarded in a special shrine built within the precincts of the royal palace, wherever the capital was located. The ruins of these former shrines remain in the ancient capitals of Anuradapura, Pollonnaruwa, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Kotte and Gampola.



The first “Dalada Madura” or temple in Kandy, which housed the sacred tooth relic was built by King Wimaladharmasuriya during his reign 1592 – 1604 CE. Because in Buddhism a relic of Siddartha Gautama is equal to the presence of the Buddha himself, the Temple of the Tooth claimed instant reverence in the Buddhist community and was immediately understood to be sacred. Yet, the cultural and political importance of the temple also made it a target for a series of imperialist invaders. First, In the late 16th century the Portuguese invaded Sri Lanka in hopes of imposing their desire to strengthen spice trades. In the midst of this invasion, the Portuguese destroyed The Temple of the Tooth and subsequently stole the tooth relic itself. The Portuguese hoped to hold the relic ransom and eventually sell it back to Sri Lanka for a hefty price. However, the possession of the relic led to much turmoil and eventually the Portuguese decided to destroy the tooth. Many historians believe that the tooth destroyed by the Portuguese was a decoy tooth and that the \[real] tooth relic was not destroyed. However, other historians argue that while the original tooth relic was destroyed, there were several other tooth relics that were preserved and one of these is the modern day tooth relic. Whether or not the original tooth relic was destroyed by the Portuguese, a second temple was built in the same location by King Rajasinghe the Second during his reign from 1635 – 1687. This second iteration of the Temple of the Tooth was also destroyed, this time by the Dutch. Subsequently, a third and final temple was erected by King Wimaladharmasuriya the Second, who built a 3 storeyed temple that was later transformed by his son King Sri Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe. This 2 storeyed temple is the one which remains today.  However, even that the third and “final” iteration of the temple has undergone extensive changes after it was heavily damaged in 1998, when it was attacked by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization that fought to create an[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Eelam) independent Tamil state. The resulting damage required significant repairs and reconstruction of the 18th century version of the temple.



Including the most recent renovations in the late 20th and early 21st century, the various changes and rebuilding of the temple have served as a physical embodiment of the temple’s evolving role in Sri Lankan society. Throughout the centuries, many additions to the temple have been made by various kings and leaders who wanted to put their stamp on the structure. Due to these numerous renovations and iterations, many meaningful architectural developments have been made throughout the temple's history. The temple incorporates both Sinhalese and Shaivite elements which offer an insight into Sri Lankan history. Notably, since a large portion of the temple's design was formed before British rule over India, the temple is free of western influence on its architecture. Today, the temple contains what is understood to be classic Kandyan architecture which includes colorful roofs as well as intricately designed white walls. The main shrine has two floors. There are different chambers on every floor including the one where the tooth relic is kept known as ‘handun kunama’ (inner sanctum). The tooth is housed in a golden stupa inside the two-story shrine fronted by two large elephant tusks. The relic rests on a solid gold lotus flower, encased in jeweled caskets that sit on the throne. The temple also has several moats which are known as the wall of the water waves. The temple and its surrounding areas are purposefully designed to allow visitors to freely interact with the space, serving as a refuge for Buddhists and non Buddhists alike. In addition, the Temple hosts daily rituals performed for the Sacred Tooth Relic called “Theva” or Services, which occur three times a day. By providing this consistent Buddhist programming, these rituals are another way that the daily life of the Temple is designed to play an anchoring role in the current life of the Kandyan community.



The Temple of the tooth has also historically played a salient role in the Sri Lankan political process. The relic served as a symbol of not only the Buddha himself but also Buddhism prevailing throughout western encounters. Whoever held the tooth also held great authority within the Buddhist community.  Even the monarch Rama V was denied permission to interact with the relic, further substantiating the great reverence the monks defending the tooth relic hold. The Tooth Relic is associated inseparably with monarchy. From the 12th century until the end of the Sinhalese kingdom in 1815 during the Kingdom of Kandy, political sovereignty was inextricably associated with the possession of the Tooth Relic. However, the political significance of the Temple has changed over time. Since the contemporary government of Sri Lanka is no longer a kingdom (it is a democratic state), the Tooth Relic is not as closely connected with the government today as it was in history.



Though possession of the Tooth Relic is no longer a sign of governmental authority, it remains a significantly important and strong symbol in the civil religion in contemporary Sri Lanka. For example, the Temple continues to offer a powerful site to worship for many Buddhists. Buddhist sites that contain relics are often places that not only physically draw Buddhists closer by celebrating their rich religious history, but also unite the community as one. Many Buddhists feel a sense of security and belonging in temples, thus adding to their value. Today, an annual festival is held during July or August at the Temple of the Tooth known as Esala Perahera. This festival lasts for 10 days, and throughout the duration of the festival, there are many musicians, performers, and Elephants decorated with colorful garments. The purpose of this festival is to worship the sacred tooth and bond the Kandy community with many exciting festivities. 



This Temple of the Tooth provides an instructive example of how sacred religious relics play a role not only in their respective religions but also in their communities as a whole. For example, since other countries and leaders recognized the tooth relic as socially and politically significant, they tried to appropriate the tooth (both physically and metaphorically) in order to  impose political authority. In this way, relics can serve as a literal physical form of power. At the same time, the Temple of the Tooth exemplifies how Sacred Spaces in South Asia can act as safe spaces for the community. Many Buddhists feel at ease and at home when in the Temple of the Tooth. Also, with the various festivals and forms of worship, people find a sense of belonging by not only witnessing but also partaking in these sacred acts.
