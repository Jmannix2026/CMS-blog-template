The Temple of The Tooth in Practice

The Temple of the Tooth was heavily damaged in 1998, when it was attacked by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization that fought to create an [independent Tamil state.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Eelam) The resulting damage required significant repairs and reconstruction of the 18th century version of the temple. Through the reconstruction of the physical space of the Temple of the Tooth, three vital aspects of its identity emerged: 1) its function as a place of worship;  2) its role in the community;  3)  its continuity with past and future generations (Wijesuriya 2000).



In order to understand the function of the Temple of the Tooth, it is important to understand the physical space. While the physical space of the temple has evolved over thousands of years and multiple reconstructions, the current iteration retains many of the characteristics of the temple erected by King Wimaladharmasuriya the Second and his son King Sri Veera Parakrama Narendrasinghe. The entire temple complex is built using classical Kandyan architecture with very little, if any, Western influence. Multiple elaborate creamy white buildings, topped by traditional red roofs, simultaneously convey tranquility and grandiosity. The main entrance gate, which lies over a moat, is called Mahawahalkada. Stone carvings of elephants straddle the entrance. To the right of the entrance, an octagonal building known as the Pattirippuwa, is visible. The Pattirippuwa is meant to serve as the symbolic representation of the city of Kandy (Wijesuriya 2000) and was originally built for public viewings of the Tooth. Visitors cross over the moat on a stone bridge and take a stairway leading to a passageway, then walk through a stone doorway with beautifully carved Makara Torana on top and two "Doratupala" or Door Keeper figures on either side. Visitors then pass through a long, narrow tunnel called the "Ambarawa" in order to enter the "Hewisi Mandapaya" or the Drummers' Courtyard. This Drummers' Courtyard is a relatively large space (almost 5000 square feet) which is situated in front of the two storied main shrine where the Tooth Relic is kept. The two storeys of the main shrine are known as "Palle malaya" (lower floor) and "Udu malaya" (upper floor), also known as "Weda hitina maligawa". The doors of the Weda Hitana Maligawa are carved in ivory. On the upper floor, the chamber in which the tooth relic is kept is known as the "Handun kunama".The walls and the wooden surfaces are all painted in traditional motifs. Importantly, there are several other shrines scattered throughout the temple complex.



People often travel to the Temple in large groups - whether the groups are religious pilgrims or tourists. As visitors approach the Temple,  they walk through a crowded marketplace filled with an array of vendors looking to sell flowers and other offerings. The marketplace serves as a physical reminder of the Temple’s importance in local commerce. Once inside the Temple, visitors are inspected for proper attire. Since the Temple is an active place of worship, every visitor must wear modest clothing that covers their shoulders and lower half. Also, visitors must not wear shoes and are mandated to put their foot coverings in a designated area protected by guards. Once the clothing and footwear inspection has been completed, visitors enter a stream of people which acts as a current towards the upstairs where the tooth is kept. Visitors have a few moments to observe the tooth held in the golden stupa, then are ushered away by monks to make room for others. Visitors then have the option of making their way to the areas designated for giving offerings or going to the museum. In fact, visitors are generally welcome to roam as they please within the Temple and are not forced to follow any specific time frame. For example, visitors have time to linger in prayer or other forms of contemplation in the shrines (other than the main shrine).  Visitors may also choose to spend hours in the  museum, which is home to significant Kandyan artifacts as well as several Buddhist items. Taken together, the technical logistics of visiting the Temple demonstrate a disciplined, egalitarian ethos: while there may be strict guidelines by which everyone must abide, visitors can interact with the space at their own pace. Therefore, while the sacred space must be fundamentally respected, people still hold a sense of agency within those spaces.

The Temple continues to serve a vital role in the Sri Lankan community, both in terms of its role as a religious space but also as a site of cultural heritage and tourism. The temple remains an active place of worship and these rituals serve as an anchor for the daily activities of the community at large. These rituals are performed three times a day: at dawn, at noon and in the evening. In addition, the temple frequently hosts festivals which serve to unite the local community and the larger nation with a bond of shared culture. The Temple’s vibrant festivals and renowned relics also draws tourism, thereby giving Sri Lankan culture an international platform which in turn strengthens the drive to preserve Sri Lankan culture (and acts as a powerful driver for the local economy). In this way, the Temple of The Tooth transcends its religious power and holds ongoing value for its community and country. 



Related to the religious and community importance of the Temple, is its role as a custodian of social continuity in Sri Lanka. Indeed, the recent extensive repairs of the Temple of the Tooth required those tasked with its restoration to contemplate the role of the Temple in preserving continuity between the past and the future of Sri Lanka.  For example, as part of the restoration process, certain craftspeople were needed as stone carvers.  The monks of the Temple of the Tooth insisted that the materials and craftspeople would be derived locally (Wijesuriya 2000).  In the case of stone carving, this craft had almost died in Sri Lanka. However, the monk’s insistence on local crafts-sourcing resulted in the development of a whole new generation of stone-carvers in Sri Lanka. In this way, the Temple seemed to almost physically require the Sri Lankan community to maintain certain crafts traditions in order to preserve the Temple itself (Stanley-Price 2005).  The Temple also serves a similar role in maintaining the continuity of religious practices in the Buddhist community.



In many ways, the reconstruction of the temple allowed the current generation to make a purposeful statement about how they want to interact - physically, socially, and spiritually -  with the Temple, thereby redefining the role of the sacred space for a whole new generation of Sinhalese.  In keeping many architectural features found in earlier versions of the temple, modern generations are able to connect with and understand the history surrounding the site. By actively engaging in the restoration of the Temple, the Sinhlaese people have recommitted to the importance of the sacred space in their society. International visitors, too, now understand that the Temple of The Tooth is not only home to its sacred artifacts, but also the custodian of the rich Sri Lankan history. The practices today in the Temple continue to anchor the local community in time and space, serving as the daily heartbeat of the larger society. This shows us that a sacred space in the modern era is an accumulation of all its past events and survives by asserting its relevance to modern society. Something may become sacred because of an artifact or event, but it remains sacred by redefining itself throughout history.
